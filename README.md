# My Home Assistant Configuration
I'm often behind on updating the readme. Ask me about anything!
My configuration is broken down into [packages](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/README.md, sort of mini configuration-files. This makes it easy to see everything pertaining to a specific automation or implementation.

## Automation hall of fame
### My favorite automations
* [Sending notifications when we get mail or packages in mailbox](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/mailbox.yaml)
* [Setting air cleaner in bedroom to quiet at 9 pm (before bedtime) and auto at 11 am (when we are sure to have gotten out of bed), using Broadlink RM3 mini ir blaster](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/air_cleaner.yaml)
* [Set light status on a few lights inside and outside based on time of day,](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/lights_in_morning.yaml) [sun](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/lights_at_dark.yaml) [and when we come home](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/lights_at_presence.yaml)
* [Xiaomi switch by the bed toggles bedside lamp (single press), bedroom ceiling light (double press) or dim and brighten bedside lamp (long press)](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/bedroom_lights.yaml)
* [Not smart Roomba only vacuums when we're not home, starts using Broadlink RM3 mini ir blaster](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/roomba.yaml)
* [Monitoring and notifications when washer](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/laundry_washing_machine.yaml) [and dryer are done](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/laundry_dryer.yaml)
* [Say good morning to Siri and she turns on a couple of lights, and turns on the morning show on the living room tv if it's a work day](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/good_morning.yaml)

* [Notifications for cleaning cat litterboxes](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom/HomeAssistantConfiguration/blob/master/packages/litterbox_upstairs.yaml)

## Future plans:

* Automate turning on and off charging of e-bike battery, with notifications (need another Fibaro wall plug)
